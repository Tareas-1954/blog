This is my 7th week in my YWeb class. This week was very very hard for me. I almost quit because my husband was disappointed that I spend so many hours working at Perkins restaurant with other students to cough up my work, and I used to arrive home after 12am and he said he didn&rsquo;t see me at home as a wife. Well teacher, I am here doing my best in my work, and thank you for helping me when I came to you with work questions. This week, I am working in CSS Zen Garden and a little bit in my portfolio, and also trying to finish Code School Foundations.</p>

The Madison + UX was very educational for me, I really appreciated to have the opportunity to attend the presentation. I have a better idea on how much I can do if I continue to study the technology (the new world).</p>
