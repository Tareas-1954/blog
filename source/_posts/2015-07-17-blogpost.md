This is my fifth week of my journal.
My week was very busy. I worked in Front End Foundations Level 1, and I finished my work on Formations Level 1 and 2. This week was very hard trying to finish my work from Java Script- Chapter 2. I work most of the time at night doing my chapter 2 to be done I spend most of my life working to try to complete my assigned work on time.
