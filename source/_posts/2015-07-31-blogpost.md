This is my 7th week in my YWeb class. This week was very very hard for me. I almost quit because my husband was disappointed that I spend so many hours working at Perkins restaurant with other students to cough up my work, and I used to arrive home after 12am and he said he didn't see me at home as a wife. Well teacher, I am here doing my best in my work, and thank you for helping me when I came to you with work questions. This week, I am working in CSS Zen Garden and a little bit in my portfolio, and also trying to finish Code School Foundations.
