This is my 6th week of my journal. On this week, I feel very busy doing the Java Script chapter 3 and I am still working in that, but also I was doing another project that it is the portfolio. I worked very hard I am trying to send my work on time but it sounds like I couldn't make it.  I keep going and do my work as much I can.
